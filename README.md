# NextJS Typescript scaffolds

This repository contains a small collection of pre-made NextJS scaffolds. You can find the newest release of each scaffold under the [Releases](https://github.com/benediktkaiser/nextjs-ts-scaffolds/releases).

If you run into any issue feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/benediktkaiser/nextjs-ts-scaffolds/issues/new). If you would like to request a new scaffold you can also [open a new issue](https://github.com/benediktkaiser/nextjs-ts-scaffolds/issues/new) for this.

## Contributing
We generally maintain these scaffolds internally, however if you would like to open a pull request, we will be willing to look over it.

## Development
To locally zip all the scaffolds run the following command in the root directory

```shell
sh zip-scaffolds.sh
```

You will then find all the scaffolds under the `/dist` folder.
